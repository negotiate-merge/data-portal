# Problems
- [ ] Logout is not working correctly on the front end, says user is still logged in even when session has been cleared. It's a localstorage issue.

When the above is fixed we will rebuild the project and then we can keep it up for assessment.

- [x] Rewrite backend to use log file instead of print statements and then configure gunicorn for stable uptime demonstration purposes.
- [ ] Upgrade vis.gl to the latest version keep note of the current version in case of breaking changes.
- [ ] Fix up the rest of the graph
  - Longer term make the code more modular - we are currently repeating the whole block for a new graph.
- [ ] Construct an org table to hold details about the the organisations that users are associated with.
- [ ] Construct a licenses table to hold details of devices permitted per organization.
- [ ] Make nav bar stick to the top of the page
- [ ] Make the fake data sender more realistic.. will put it on a raspberry pie in the office.
